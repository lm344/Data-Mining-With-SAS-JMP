# Data-Mining-With-SAS-JMP

This was my final project of my Masters:

Data Mining for Managers)

Three Sectional Requirements:
(Remember, you are a manager that utilizes data mining to make critical business decisions.  You are operating in the high-paced competitive information economy.  You are required to make sound judgments based on data analytics.  Your competitors are trying to put you out of business…Don’t let them!).

1)  Input-data analysis. 
You will receive an excel file with data that describes a particular 
business process.  You are required to analyze the data and adjust it (e.g. formats, content) to focus your research.  In other words, you will be required to “trouble shoot” the data file and tell your data warehousing person what is wrong with it.  

For example: are there errors; what variables are unnecessary (must the file be adjusted in order to perform a data mining analysis)?  You are to return the adjusted file along with any other requirements that are stipulated on that file.


2)  I will be given an Excel file with a number of variables to run a regression analysis. 
      I will use the statistical output of the model to help make decisions on how to adjust  
      My operational activities to best locate and operate a higher-tier restaurant. We are to analyze your regression results and devise a simple business plan using whatever information is critical to your strategic decision.   We also are required to use the results of your model to estimate the expected monthly revenue at your proposed restaurant. Finally, I need to analyze the data file with a neural net methodology and compare the results to the regression analysis for expected revenue.

      
3) I am now to use your expertise in data analysis and must come up with a model that describes a particular process.  I must identify some type of process that you can better understand by mining data corresponding to that process (e.g. driver and target variables).  I need to identify real data variables for your model and choose any mining method to analyze it.

My report will be approximately 4 pages or so.  I need to:
	
-	Describe the process you are mining
-	Describe and illustrate the variables in your analysis (provide a definition of the data and a snap shot of what the data looks like)
-	Site where you can obtain the data.
-	Describe your analysis (e.g. clustering, neural net, segmentation) on your data and your data prep activities.
-	Describe the benefits of what your model provides (what value does your mining analysis provide for users).
